Language models take text as input - that text is commonly referred to as a prompt. Typically this is not simply a hardcoded string but rather a combination of a template, some examples, and user input. LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

The following sections of documentation are provided:
â€¢ None Getting Started: An overview of all the functionality LangChain provides for working with and constructing prompts.
â€¢ None Key Concepts: A conceptual guide going over the various concepts related to prompts.
â€¢ None How-To Guides: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to accomplish various objectives with our prompt class.
