# This script uses ChatGPT to help write up various aspects of a character design, such as their description, goals, and writing style.

# All these args start with ":", meaning that the passed values will be interpreted as literal strings instead of being evaluated by the interpreter.
args :prompt, :aspect, :context, :example character, :example result

# Create a ChatInstance, called "writer"

# These are some pretty extreme settings, but they seem to work well for this script.

# First, the system message lays out the purpose of this chat
<system @ writer> I will assist the user in inventing a character. In particular, I will be helping them come up with {aspect}. My response should be worded so that it would fit in as the end of this sentence: "{context}...". I will not include "{context}" in my reply, just the rest of the sentence, and no further commentary.

# Now, a user asks the assistant for help, reiterating the format of the reply.
<writer+> Hello! I have a character idea and I need your help deciding on {aspect}. Also, I need you to reply only by completing the sentence "{context}..." and producing no other output. To show that you understand, please tell me what you would write for the character {example character}.

# The system reminds the assistant of the context of its reply
<system @ writer> Complete the sentence: {context}

# We fill in the kind of reply we'd expect for our example character
<assistant @ writer> {example result}.

# Now, the user asks for help with the actual character
<writer+> Excellent, you got the reply format exactly right. Now, here\'s my character idea: {prompt}

# The system reminds the assistant of the context of its reply once more
<system @ writer> Complete the sentence: {context}

# And now we make the actual OpenAI api request, and hopefully we get a good result for our efforts.
return <writer++>
